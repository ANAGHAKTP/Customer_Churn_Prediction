# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction

Welcome to the Telco Customer Churn Prediction project. This project is dedicated to predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry, a vital task for businesses aiming to retain their customers and make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Telco_customer_churn.xlsx`. It contains information about Telco customers, including demographics, service subscriptions, and customer churn status. The dataset consists of various features, encompassing both numerical and categorical variables.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
1.  **Churn Prediction**: Develop accurate machine learning models that can predict which customers are likely to churn. By identifying at-risk customers early, companies can take proactive measures to retain them.
2.  **Data Analysis**: Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into customer behavior, demographics, and the factors influencing churn. EDA helps in understanding the dataset and uncovering actionable patterns.
3.  **Model Building**: Utilize various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. These models will help classify customers as potential churners or non-churners.
4.  **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation provides an understanding of how well the models perform in practice.
5.  **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations and insights based on the analysis and model outcomes. These recommendations can guide business strategies to reduce churn rates.

## How to Use

To work with this project, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
*   pandas
*   numpy
*   scikit-learn

You can then use the provided Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to explore the data, build models, and make predictions.
